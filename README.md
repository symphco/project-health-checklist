Project Health Checklist
========================
![alt text](images/health-notification.png)

**Mechanics:**
- All projects start off as **"Unhealthy"** `‚ÄºÔ∏è`
- Every week Projects are automatically scanned on Github and those that are **Unhealthy** `‚ÄºÔ∏è` and **Getting There** `‚ö†Ô∏è` will be announced and tagged in `#Devs` chat channel.
- In order to be **Healthy** `üü¢`, project team must complete the checklist to at least **90%**.
- Upon **4** Consecutive tag on the chat channel, project team will be required to schedule a checklist review with the Engineering Lead within **4** days to understand how to address the issues and set a target date for checklist completion.
- A status badge will be added on the Project repository for quick checking of its health status (including date of last check). (Status: **Unhealthy** `‚ÄºÔ∏è`, **Getting There** `‚ö†Ô∏è` - 70%+, **Healthy** `üü¢` 90%+ Checklist) and is automatically updated to the latest status every week.
- All checklist updates and changes will be done via an update to the project `README.md` and is PR'd to the main working branch.
- For Healthy projects, a `monthly automatic health check notification` will be done on the `#Devs` chat channel and a review will be scheduled with the Engineering Lead to ensure the project is still healthy - otherwise the project will be marked as **Unhealthy** `‚ÄºÔ∏è` or **Getting There** `‚ö†Ô∏è`

### Documentation and Readability:

- [ ] Does the app pass Snyk Scans? (No High/Criticals/Mediums)
- [ ] Does the code maintain at least 80% Sonar Cloud Code Coverage?
- [ ] Are there no Critical/Blocker/Major Vulnerability Issues reported in Github and Sonar Cloud?
- [ ] Are there automated tests covering critical functionality and components?
- [ ] Is there a CI pipeline for automated builds and testing (e.g., Github Actions, Cloud Build, Azure DevOps)?
- [ ] Are unnecessary console logs and debug logs removed?
- [ ] Are API routes appropriately protected, ensuring only public routes are accessible?
- [ ] Are dependencies and third-party libraries updated to their latest versions?

### Reliability and Disaster Recovery:
- [ ] Is there a clear project ownership structure? (Know who to ask for help should issue arises)
- [ ] Is there a disaster recovery plan in place for critical failures or data loss (Database and Storage)?
- [ ] Is there a monitoring and alerting system (e.g., Sentry) to detect and respond to issues?
